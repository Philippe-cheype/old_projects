# Old Projects

### Info

These are projects I've worked on in the past, from 2015 - 2019.

Some of these programs are not finished others don't work anymore because of incompatibility, but some projects are fully finishied.

Remember my knowledge of some of these programming languages is very basic, I was just having fun with a hobby I had just discovered.

I'm now a student in computer science at Epitech. These projects are what led me here.

:memo: If you see the pseudo-name "NDexis", that's me, my old alias.
