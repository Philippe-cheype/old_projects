# Connection Tester

#### Info

This is a very simple project that pings Google every n ticks to check if Internet is up or down.

Depending on the status the circle would change :
- Gray => Unknown
- Red => Internet down
- Green => Internet up

#### Disclaimer

The method of pinging Google is very inefficient, so it's very laggy.

I was aware of this at the time but because of my limited knowledge in VB and C#, I wasn't able to find a solution to optimize it.
