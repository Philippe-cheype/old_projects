#### Info
Ceci est mon site web. Projet de clase d'ISN en Terminale.
This was my website back in 2018 - 2019, in "Terminale" ( = 12th grade / Senior Year).
It was my computer science beginning of year project that I kept updated all along the year.
The exercises were given by our teacher.

I would recommend checking `v3/index.html`, this was the latest version and you can access every other version from here.

I originally hosted this on netlify (free GitHub based website hosting), I still own the site but I've taken down the website
I'm writing this the 6/01/21, I'm soon going to update my website and actually buy a domain this time.

#### Disclaimer

I know the projects in `devoirs/` are very poorly organized (CSS and JS are all included in the HTML file).
This was mostly for the teachers convenience, it was easier to send a one-file project to him than a compressed file (don't ask why, I don't understand either).
